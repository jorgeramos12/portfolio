User Story

AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

 Acceptance Criteria

Presented once I open a potential employee's portfolio, I am shown the developer's name, a current photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their accomplishments, and how to get in touch with them.
If I select one of the links in the navigation, the UI scrolls to the correct area. Whenever I press the link to the section about their accomplishments, the UI scrolls to a section with named photographs of the developer's applications.
When I am shown the developer's first application, its picture should be larger than the others. Once I click on the images of the apps, I am transported to that deployed application. Anytime I adjust the page or browse the site on different screens and devices, I see a responsive layout that conforms to my viewport.
