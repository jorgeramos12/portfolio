            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I enjoy traveling, listening to music, and learning new things. I decided to take this course due to
                interest and lack of knowledge. This is a big step for me in my career and I do not plan to miss it. My
                goal is meet the requirements and enjoy the struggle it takes to do it. I like to live like there is no
                tomorrow. Accomplishing my goals is the most important part of my day. </p>

            <p> The first challenge faced in bootcamp. The goal was to make it more semantic and fix any mistakes to
                accomplish the right look. This is the only project I've completed so far. This portfolio website will
                count as my second.</p>
